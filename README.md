# iframe-app

## Setup

*  [Install lein](http://leiningen.org/) (it's easy)
*  Clone this repo
*  Run lein figwheel and wait for it to fetch dependencies and run
*  Add this [nginx site](https://gist.github.com/atroche/52f0037313d7d2d1120b) 
*  Use the sidebar icon app (iframe app) to point to https://figwheel.zd-dev.com
*  Open up the app in an agent interface

Whenever you change the source, figwheel will recompile the javascript and reload it in the browser.
